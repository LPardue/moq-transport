              Warp - Low-Latency Video Transport over QUIC
                        draft-lcurley-warp-quic

Abstract

   This document defines the Warp video transport protocol.  Warp
   utilizes [QUIC] to deliver live media streams over the network.
   These streams are prioritized based on the underlying encoding to
   minimize latency.

1.  Overview

2.  Background

2.1.  Congestion

   Congestion occurs when a network is oversaturated and is unable to
   deliver packets in a timely manner.  [QUIC-RECOVERY] outlines how
   QUIC limits the transmission rate in response to congestion.

   During periods of congestion, the encoder bitrate can exceed the
   network bitrate.  To remediate the situation, media must be queued or
   dropped until the sufficiently network recovers.

2.2.  Latency

   The latency of a video transport protocol depends on how timely it
   can respond to congestion.  A low-latency video transport protocol
   will deliver newly generated media at the expense of older media.
   This means dropping older media, which can have side-effects
   depending on the encoding.

2.3.  Video

   Video encoding works by computing deltas between frames.  Each frame
   can depend on 0, 1, or multiple frames in the past, or somtimes
   future.

   There are a few common frame types: * I frames are effectively a
   static image, so they are relatively large * P frames depend on
   previous I or P frames. * B frames depend on future P or B frames,
   and possibly previous I or P frames,

   It's important to take video encoding into account when delivering
   low-latency media over a network.  The decision to drop a frame at
   the network level can cause video decoding errors impacting other
   frames.

2.4.  Audio

   Audio encoding works by producing groups of samples at a specified
   frequency.

   Audio samples do not depend on each other and can be more freely
   dropped at the network level.  However, some video protocols like
   WebRTC choose to prioritize audio over video for a few reasons:

   *  Audio is more important for some applications (ex.
      teleconferencing)

   *  Audio gaps are far more noticable.

   *  Audio uses a fraction of the bandwidth.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
