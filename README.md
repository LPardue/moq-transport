All changes need to be made to the markdown file (.md).
You can find a reference for the synatax [here](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).

If you want to rebuild the xml/html/text files, you'll need to first install [kramdown-rfc2629](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc).
There's a simple Makefile included: `make html`
