                      Warp - Live Video Transport
                        draft-lcurley-warp-quic

Abstract

   This document defines the Warp video transport protocol.  Warp
   utilizes [QUIC] to deliver live media streams over the network.
   These streams are prioritized based on the underlying encoding to
   minimize latency.

3.  Background

3.1.  Encoding

   In order to optimize media delivery over a network, it's important to
   have a basic understanding of how media is encoded.

3.1.1.  Video

   Video encoding works by computing deltas between frames.  Each frame
   can depend on 0, 1, or multiple frames in the past, or sometimes
   future.

   There are a few common frame types:

   *  I frames are effectively a static image, so they are relatively
      large

   *  P frames depend on previous I or P frames.

   *  B frames depend on future P or B frames, and possibly previous I
      or P frames,

3.1.2.  Audio

   Audio encoding works by producing samples at a specified frequency.
   These samples are grouped together based on the sample rate (also
   called frames).  Unlike video, groups of audio samples do not depend
   on each other.

   Some video transport protocols (like WebRTC) choose to prioritize
   audio over video for a few reasons:

   *  Audio is more important for some applications (ex.
      teleconferencing)

   *  Audio gaps are far more noticable.

   *  Audio uses a fraction of the bandwidth.

3.2.  Latency

   The latency of a video protocol depends on how long media frames are
   queued.  Media can be queued for a number of different reasons, such
   as to improve the compression ratio by using more reference frames.

   For a video transport protocol, the vast majority of queuing (and
   thus latency) is caused by network congestion.

3.3.  Congestion

   Congestion occurs when a network is oversaturated and is unable to
   deliver packets in a timely manner.

   During periods of congestion, intermediate routers will queue and
   eventually drop packets.  Excessive queuing causes bufferbloat,
   increasing latency and eating into any buffer maintained by the
   receiver.

   [QUIC-RECOVERY] outlines how QUIC limits the transmission rate in
   response to congestion.  When this happens, encoder bitrate can
   exceed that of the transmission bitrate and results in queuing.  The
   ability to rapidly respond to this situation determines the latency
   of a video transport protocol.

3.3.1.  Encoder Backpressure

   The simplest response to network congestion is to reduce the encoder
   bitrate.  The encoder can be reconfigured relatively quickly, while
   any queued media is delivered or reencoded.

   However, tweaking the encoder bitrate has ramifications when there
   are multiple recipients.  Network congestion for one receipient will
   cause degraded video quality for other participants.

3.3.2.  Media Dropping

   As mentioned in the encoding section, video frames and audio samples
   only sometimes depend on each other.  It is possible to deliver
   certain frames out-of-order or drop them entirely.

   The effective media bitrate can be reduced by dropping frames at the
   network layer.  The specific frames dropped have an impact on media
   decoding, so it's important that the network layer takes this into
   account.
