                      Warp - Live Video Transport
                        draft-lcurley-warp-base

Abstract

   This document defines the core behavior for Warp video transport
   protocol family: [WARP-QUIC] and [WARP-HTTP3].  Warp is the method of
   mapping of live media to QUIC streams based on the underlying media
   encoding.  Latency is minimized achieved by prioritizing the delivery
   of specific streams during congestion.

1.  Overview

   Warp is a live video transport protocol that utilizes the [QUIC]
   network protocol.  There are two Warp variants depending on product
   requirements:

   *  [WARP-QUIC] is an API on top of QUIC.

   *  [WARP-HTTP3] is an API on top of HTTP/3, primarily for
      distribution over CDNs.

   This document covers the shared behavior for both variants.

2.  Background

2.1.  Encoding

   In order to optimize media delivery over a network, it's important to
   have a basic understanding of how media is encoded.

2.1.1.  Video

   Video encoding works by computing deltas between frames.  Each frame
   can depend on 0, 1, or multiple frames in the past, or sometimes
   future.

   There are a few common frame types:

   *  I frames are effectively a static image, so they are relatively
      large

   *  P frames depend on previous I or P frames.

   *  B frames depend on future P or B frames, and possibly previous I
      or P frames,

2.1.2.  Audio

   Audio encoding works by producing samples at a specified frequency.
   These samples are grouped together based on the sample rate (also
   called frames).  Unlike video, groups of audio samples do not depend
   on each other.

   Some video transport protocols (like WebRTC) choose to prioritize
   audio over video for a few reasons:

   *  Audio is more important for some applications (ex.
      teleconferencing)

   *  Audio gaps are far more noticable.

   *  Audio uses a fraction of the bandwidth.

2.2.  Latency

   The latency of a video protocol depends on how long media frames are
   queued.  Media can be queued for a number of different reasons, such
   as to improve the compression ratio by using more reference frames.

Internet-Draft                  WARP-BASE                    August 2021


   For a video transport protocol, the vast majority of queuing (and
   thus latency) is caused by network congestion.

2.3.  Congestion

   Congestion occurs when a network is oversaturated and is unable to
   deliver packets in a timely manner.

   During periods of congestion, intermediate routers will queue and
   eventually drop packets.  Excessive queuing causes bufferbloat,
   increasing latency and eating into any buffer maintained by the
   receiver.

   [QUIC-RECOVERY] outlines how QUIC limits the transmission rate in
   response to congestion.  When this happens, encoder bitrate can
   exceed that of the transmission bitrate and results in queuing.  The
   ability to rapidly respond to this situation determines the latency
   of a video transport protocol.

2.3.1.  Encoder Backpressure

   The simplest response to network congestion is to reduce the encoder
   bitrate.  The encoder can be reconfigured relatively quickly, while
   any queued media is delivered or reencoded.

   However, tweaking the encoder bitrate has ramifications when there
   are multiple recipients.  Network congestion for one receipient will
   cause degraded video quality for other participants.

2.3.2.  Media Dropping

   As mentioned in the encoding section, video frames and audio samples
   only sometimes depend on each other.  It is possible to deliver
   certain frames out-of-order or drop them entirely.

   The effective media bitrate can be reduced by dropping frames at the
   network layer.  The specific frames dropped have an impact on media
   decoding, so it's important that the network layer takes this into
   account.

3.  Streams

   QUIC provides independent streams multiplexed over a connection.
   These streams are ordered and reliable, but can be closed early by
   either endpoint.

   Media sent over a single QUIC stream would suffer from head-of-line
   blocking.  Warp avoids this by utilizing multiple concurrent QUIC
   streams based on the media encoding.

   For [WARP-HTTP3], these concepts apply to the underlying
   bidirectional stream for each request.

3.1.  Prioritization

   The sender gives each QUIC stream a priority based on its contents,
   as defined below.

   Warp uses a strict prioritzation scheme, such that any available
   bandwidth is allocated to streams in descending priority order.  This
   requires support on the sender side only.

   During congestion, this prioritization will intentionally cause
   stream starvation for the lowest priority streams.

3.1.1.  Media Type

   Audio and video are split into separate QUIC streams.  The timestamp
   within the media container is used for synchronization.

   Audio streams SHOULD be prioritized over video streams.  This enables
   the receiver to skip video while audio continues uninterupted during
   congestion.

3.1.2.  Video Streams

   Video is split into a separate QUIC streams that can be delivered and
   decoded independently.  This is done by splitting at GoP boundaries,
   ideally one stream per GoP.  A video stream is finalized when the
   next one begins.

   For live content, newer video streams SHOULD be prioritized over
   older video streams.  This enables the receiver to skip over older
   content during congestion.

   QUIC streams are reliable and ordered, so frames are flushed to the
   application in decode order.  This is ideal when the GoP structure is
   linear or unknown, as it prevents decode errors.

   A future version of Warp could optimize for other GoP structures.
   For example, non-reference frames could be sent over a lower priority
   stream.  This added complexity is situational and does not seem
   necessary at this time.

3.1.3.  Audio Streams

   Audio samples are also split into separate QUIC streams.  These
   boundaries are based on the frequency and sample rate.  An audio
   stream is finalized when the next one begins.

   For live content, newer audio streams CAN be prioritized over older
   audio streams.  This enables the receiver to skip ahead after
   persistent congestion.

3.2.  Retransmissions

   STREAM frames may be lost over the network and require retransmision.
   A Warp sender MAY choose to delay retransmitting these frames if a
   higher priority stream can be sent instead.

   When this is done, stream prioritization MUST still obey QUIC flow
   control.  STREAM frames counts towards flow control limits, even when
   lost, until the frame is acknowledged or the stream reset.  A Warp
   sender SHOULD retransmit frames instead of prioritizing other streams
   when nearing connection flow control limits.

3.3.  Closure

   Due to the strict prioritization, streams may be starved
   indefinitely.  Both the sender and receiver SHOULD close the lowest
   priority stream when nearing resource limits.

   The receiver CAN close a stream after it has been skipped to reduce
   network usage.

3.4.  Multiple Tracks

   Sessions can support multiple tracks or renditions.  These SHOULD be
   sent over separate QUIC streams and CAN be prioritized.
